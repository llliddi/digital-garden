Red and blue flowers, sometimes decorating a wreath and sometimes just in the hands, the teenagers are blooming just like them. Naked bodies of human beings leaving the childhood and understanding their newly found youth is the most important theme of this controversial painting. The girl that is our main character seems to be understanding of her newly found features. She's both playing around, showing her childishness while also acknowledging the newly percieved gazes from other adolescents! 

I love this painting because the gaze coming from our main character and her visual reactions to the gazes and her own body changing encapculates the feeling of frustration and curiosity that comes with being a woman well.  You understand you're changing and it's visible. It's frustrating and it's painful. You see it, they see it. You do not know how to understand the gazes coming from friends you once played innocently. You get confident, you get scared. 

In my interpretation, the blue-red flower in her hand is away from her body, and her eyes seem in more of a reddish hue. She's turning away from childishness and turning towards the newly found passion, she's not exactly happy with it but she's calculating what to do with it. Though the blue-ish flower is not in her view right now, she still holds onto it. Just like the other girls playing with the flowers.
