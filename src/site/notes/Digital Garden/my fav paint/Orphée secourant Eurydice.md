A lover that is too late. The brown silhouette running in panic, but the silhouette is already too far away.

Orpheus and Eurydice's story is one of, if not the most loved myth of Ovid. We all know the story so I won't be explainig it, but 

Delacroix actually has another painting in Montpellier that I had to chance of seeing:

Now, you can see that these 2 paintings really similar yet vastly different. I found the first painting through the one I already saw. I feel like it's a remade of the 2nd one. 
When you just take a quick look at the scene before us we see the panic and the sadness even if we do not see any facial expressions. We look at the way Orpheus is drawn, he doesn't have any qualities that makes us understand it's him, except from the gut wrenching and distressed figure of his. I feel like it's the same for the first painting as well.

In the first painting I put, we see that Orpheus has much more distance to the events than the 2nd one. Hell, I feel like I can only tell it's Orpheus because I saw the 2nd painting first. I like to see this two paintings as a set that follows each other. We can't see Orpheus, but we can see the faces. This is our point of view. We can't see Orpheus because he is in fact so far away from Eurydice to hold her. While, in the second picture, it feels like this is what Orpheus perceives. Orpheus desperately wishes the road to be shorter, he only has the thought of "a little bit more" in his mind. To get that bit done and hold her dying lover, aid her. He's in a moment of disarray, his entire world shaking in a moment of his that was supposed to be his maybe most important one. He can't see anyone's faces, even his lovers'. Only thing he can do is run and run and run.

Relationship of the concept of Distance and Orpheus is one of the most integral relationships in their story. Orpheus walked a long way for Eurydice, to have her all he had to do was never look back. He went through that distance only to look back at the last moment. Thinking of it, how long must that road look to Orpheus. Walking and walking and walking for days maybe for his beloved.

And now, he is sprinting this large distance, desperately hoping for it to be a really short one even though it isn't. Maybe this distance he ran right before Eurydice died is the same as the distance he walked with Eurydice behind him.
