First thing i'D like to say about why this still life is in Mus√©e Faeterra is... 
I loveb ugs 
And one of my favorite animals is sunskinks. When i saw the lizard i gasped and said "is that a sunskink??"
It isn'T. (clearly too) (Because sunskinks have much smoother bodies, this guy has MUSCLES).  The lizard and the snake are hissing at each other. Maybe it's territorial maybe it's to fight over who gets the food (maybe the butterfly that is right in front of them). 

The terrain itself looks so detailed. The mossy ground looks like it has hidden living beings hiding beneath, like if i were to start the time, something would jump the butterfly while the lame-o's are fighting each other. And the huge ahh snail on that terrain that looks at the fight like it's cinema going towards the thistle is so funny to me...
Now the Thistle. One of the reasons I LOVED this painting is because I don't think I've ever seen Thistle's in a Still Life. This might not mean much but I did my erasmus in Netherlands, where Still Life paintings, especially Vanitas' THRIVED. Apart from the artists name which is clearly Dutch, it's hyper-realism actually gives away the era that it was painted. Baroque. This period was the height of Dutch painting scene and is home to some of my favorite still lifes as well. From the usage of monochrome colouring we can say it's from more Dutch areas, rather than cities like Antwerp. The artist is from Nijmegen, which is in the east side of the Netherlands. Gelderland, which is the state Nijmegen belongs to, is also known for it's beautiful forests, which lines up with this beautiful under-the-forest still life!

The Dutch/Flemish context also gives us another concept of this still life: Vanitas. Vanitas are still life artworks that aim to let people remember that their life will end these worldly desires or objects will be gone.  The action of fighting in-between the living beings remind us of survival and life itself while  the moths, butterflies and snails itself represent the fragility of life. Especially snails represented the fragility of life because bible directly referenced them in Psalm 58. Snails in medieval art was even better. They kept on fighting. I will talk about that on another post lol.

But here, they are there to remind us that life goes by fast. We see in the dark contrasts, predators looming in the ground of the forest while butterflies and moths are all light white and red, in order to give the impressions of life, death and hunt. 

We can also see a little ladybug going up in order to run away from the chaos as well, contributing to the survival aspect of this painting.
