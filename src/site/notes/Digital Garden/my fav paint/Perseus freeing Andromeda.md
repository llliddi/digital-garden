Now, I haven't seen this one personally but I've seen the one from Rubens as well and while searching for other paintings of Andromeda, this one come to be m favourite. And this is all because I genuinely am bored of Greek Mythology women being depicted as perfect, blondies. But this version also has it's own faults so I will be talking about both of the paintings ![Pasted image 20250705005445.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250705005445.png)

When it comes to Andromeda, Rubens of course paints bodies much more closer to the truth, taking account of their reality rather than constructing the idealized body that i see in Titian's version.  When we look at the Perseus', one is falling. This really action focused posings seem to be a theme in Titian's other mythological paintings as well. Drama is of utmost importance. We see the hero fighting with the monster, while Andromeda is waiting for her rescue. It's the depiction of the fight, rather than depiction of Perseus and Andromeda. She's the passive one.

But when we look at the Rubens' painting, we see cupid and their interactions with each other. Their gaze lingers on each other and we can see the emotions enhancing between the couple. Rather than the damsel-in-distress Andromeda, we see her actively FEELING and engaging.
