So, you probably have seen these
![Pasted image 20250703223207.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250703223207.png)
what got my attention to this? the fact that they said "ladybugs come in one and one colour only: bright red." now.
MOST OF THE LADYBUGS THAT LAND ON MY HAND ARE BLACK OR YELLOW-ISH 
And it's stupid to say an ENTIRE FAMILY of insects (Coccinellidae) come in one colour only. 
Now the first thing you can notice is ladybugs are indeed, beetles... just learned that they call them ladybirds in UK as well (which is cute) so saying "ladybugs are bugs while asian lady beetles look more like beetles because they are beetles" is like pure absurdity... ladybugs are beetles... they look like beetles...because they are beetles???????????
Also, another point is they say they bite... there is mixed views on that to be real. Some say they are a nuisance and they do bite while some say they do not bite at all. I have never encountered a ladybug, even if discolored, bite me so i do not know the reality of this (i come across ladybugs even if it's winter time, i don't know why i attract ladybugs but i do). But what most of the sites i saw agree on IS they ooze a fluid that may cause minor allergic reactions!! This is called "Reflex Bleeding" and is used to make their predators kinda just leave them alone.
But a funny thing about them is they ARE invasive. They normally live outside and when they find a nice place they can stay for winter (like your home) they call their friends by secreting a hormone and then invade that place lol. But this is also a thing that most beetles, including other species of ladybugs do.

So in the end, this was most likely an internet scare to make people be scared of harmless beetles. Idk.
